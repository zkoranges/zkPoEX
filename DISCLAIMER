DISCLAIMER AND LEGAL NOTICE

IMPORTANT -- READ BEFORE USING THIS SOFTWARE.


1. EXPERIMENTAL SOFTWARE

This software ("zkpoex") is experimental and intended for educational and
research purposes. It is not production software. The Software
operates primarily as a local simulation environment. It does not broadcast
transactions to, or modify state on, any live blockchain network. It may,
however, connect to user-specified JSON-RPC endpoints in order to fetch public
blockchain data (e.g., block headers and Merkle proofs) required to build
inputs for local simulation and proof generation. It is provided for the
following lawful purposes, including:

  - Academic and educational study of smart contract security
  - Authorized security research and penetration testing
  - Responsible and coordinated vulnerability disclosure
  - Participation in legitimate, sanctioned bug bounty programs


2. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS

By downloading, installing, copying, or otherwise using this software, you
acknowledge and agree to the following terms in their entirety. If you do not
agree, you must immediately cease all use and delete all copies of this
software.


3. NO LIABILITY

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, the authors, contributors,
maintainers, and copyright holders of this software (collectively, "the
Authors") shall not be held liable for any claim, damages, loss, expense, or
other liability whatsoever -- whether in an action of contract, tort,
negligence, strict liability, or otherwise -- arising out of or in connection
with:

  - Any use or misuse of this software
  - Any illegal, unauthorized, or unethical activity conducted with or
    facilitated by this software
  - Any direct, indirect, incidental, special, exemplary, consequential, or
    punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, data,
    funds, goodwill, or business opportunity
  - Any interaction with third-party systems, smart contracts, protocols, or
    blockchain networks

This limitation of liability applies regardless of whether the Authors have
been advised of the possibility of such damages.


4. USER RESPONSIBILITY

You, the user, are solely and entirely responsible for:

  a. Determining the legality of your use of this software under all
     applicable local, state, national, and international laws, regulations,
     and ordinances in your jurisdiction.

  b. Obtaining explicit, written authorization before testing, probing, or
     interacting with any smart contract, protocol, network, or system you
     do not own.

  c. Following responsible disclosure practices, including timely reporting
     of discovered vulnerabilities to affected parties and refraining from
     public disclosure until patches are available or a reasonable disclosure
     timeline has elapsed.

  d. Any and all consequences that result from your use of this software,
     whether lawful or unlawful, intended or unintended.


5. PROHIBITED USE

You agree that you will not use this software to:

  - Exploit vulnerabilities in live, production systems without explicit
    written authorization from the system owner
  - Steal, misappropriate, or divert funds, tokens, NFTs, or any other
    digital or physical assets
  - Conduct denial-of-service attacks or disrupt network operations
  - Engage in extortion, coercion, or ransom demands, including threatening to
    disclose vulnerabilities, proofs, exploit details, or related information
    unless paid or otherwise compensated
  - Engage in front-running, sandwich attacks, MEV extraction, or other
    forms of market manipulation
  - Facilitate money laundering, sanctions evasion, or any activity
    prohibited by OFAC, FinCEN, or equivalent regulatory bodies
  - Violate the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), the Computer Misuse
    Act, or any equivalent legislation in any jurisdiction
  - Cause harm to individuals, organizations, protocols, or networks

SPECIFIC PROHIBITION ON UNSOLICITED PROOFS ("RANSOMWARE"): You are expressly
prohibited from using this Software to generate proofs that are sent to any
third party without their prior written consent or public invitation (e.g., a
bug bounty policy). Sending an unsolicited proof accompanied by a demand for
payment is defined as "Extortion" under this Agreement.

You agree that any proof generated by this Software for the purpose of
negotiation must be preceded by a "Commitment to Good Faith," wherein the
recipient is notified of the intent to disclose before the proof is presented.


6. INDEMNIFICATION

You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Authors from and against
any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to your use or
misuse of this software or your violation of these terms.


7. NO WARRANTY

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT. THE AUTHORS DO NOT
WARRANT THAT THE VERIFICATION LOGIC OR PROOF GENERATION IS FREE FROM BUGS, VULNERABILITIES, OR
MANIPULATION. The Authors make no warranty that the software will be
error-free, secure, or uninterrupted.


8. SEVERABILITY

If any provision of this disclaimer is found to be unenforceable or invalid
under applicable law, that provision shall be modified to the minimum extent
necessary to make it enforceable, and the remaining provisions shall continue
in full force and effect.


9. GOVERNING INTERPRETATION

This disclaimer shall be interpreted broadly in favor of the Authors and shall
supplement (not replace) the terms of the MIT License under which this software
is distributed. In the event of any conflict between this disclaimer and the
MIT License, the provision that provides the greater protection to the Authors
shall prevail to the maximum extent permitted by law.


10. AUTOMATIC TERMINATION

The license granted hereunder (MIT) is conditioned upon compliance with
Section 5 ("Prohibited Use"). Any use of this Software in violation of
Section 5 automatically and immediately terminates your rights under the
License. Upon such termination, you must cease all use and destroy all copies
of the Software. Continued use after violation constitutes willful copyright
infringement.


11. THIRD-PARTY DISPUTES

The Authors are not a party to, and have no responsibility for, any dispute,
negotiation, or agreement between a user of this Software and any third party
(including protocol teams, DAOs, or bounty programs). The generation of a
proof does not constitute an endorsement of the user's claims or authorization
of their actions.


12. NO AGENCY OR PARTNERSHIP

You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency
relationship exists between you and the Authors as a result of this Disclaimer
or use of the Software. You do not have any authority to bind the Authors in
any respect whatsoever. The Authors do not endorse, support, or guarantee the
validity of any claims made by users of this Software.
